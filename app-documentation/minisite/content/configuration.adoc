[abstract]
This page lists the placeholders available, i.e. values you can use to tune the deployment.

== Placeholders

include::{partialsdir}/placeholders/doc.adoc[]

== Completion

Often placeholders are configured using properties files (see `bundlebee/placeholders.properties`).
Using VSCode and https://github.com/rmannibucau/vscode-properties-custom-completion extension for VSCode you can even get completion on available placeholders.
